    description: Search for Orphanet classifications, a multi-hierarchical and polyparental
      system built on the Orphanet nomenclature and organised around the major medical
      specialties and based on clinical criteria according to diagnostic and therapeutic
      relevance. The result is a collection of data including the ORPHAcode and the
      preferred term of the clinical entity with a data set or each classification
      where the clinical entity is present (Hchid, the unique identifier of the classification,
      name of the classification, ORPHAcode and preferred term of the n+1 and the
      n-1 clinical entities).

      frequency (obligate, very frequent, frequent, occasional, very rare or excluded)
      and whether the annotated HPO term is a major diagnostic criterion or a pathognomonic
      sign of the rare disease. Source (PMID references), the date and the validationâ€™s
      status of the association between the rare disease and HPO terms is also available.

- name: Medical specialties of rare diseases
  externalDocs:
    description: The Orphanet classification of rare diseases has a polyparental structure.
      It implies that a clinical entity is included in as many classification hierarchies as 
      necessary depending on its clinical presentation and the medical specialties to which 
      it is relevant. In order to enable the sorting out of all rare diseases by medical 
      specialty and avoid multiple counting of multiclassified entities in statistical analysis,
      a linearisation process is applied in the Orphanet database to attribute one medical
      specialty to each clinical entity. 
      The dataset provided in this section includes all rare diseases present in the Orphanet
      nomenclature each with the medical specialty attributed as the preferential parent by Orphanet.
      It is updated once a month.

    description: Orphanet collects and curates data concerning the epidemiology of 
      rare diseases. A systematic survey of the literature is carried out in order
      to estimate the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases. The rare diseases
      epidemiology dataset includes rare diseases (ORPHAcode, preferred name,
      classification level, and typology) with available point prevalence, birth 
      prevalence, lifelong prevalence and incidence, or the number of families reported
      together with their respective intervals per geographical area.
