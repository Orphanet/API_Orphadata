  description: | 
    Orphadata API provides several GET to facilitate the exploitation of various rare disease-related datasets:
      - Rare diseases aligned with terminologies and databases    
      - Classification of rare diseases
      - Clinical signs and symptoms in rare diseases
      - Genes associated with rare diseases
      - Medical speciality of rare diseases (Linearisation)
      - Epidemiology of rare diseases
      - Natural history of rare diseases

    More information on data are available <a href="https://www.orphadata.com/orphanet-scientific-knowledge/" target="_blank">here</a>.

    These data are updated twice a year (July and December) and are also available as downloadable files both in 
    <a href="https://www.orphadata.com/orphanet-scientific-knowledge-files/" target="_blank">XML and JSON formats</a>.

- name: Medical speciality of rare diseases (Linearisation)
  externalDocs:
    description: 
      The polyparental structure of the Orphanet classification of
      rare diseases implies that a rare disease is included in as many
      classifications as necessary depending on its clinical presentation
      and the medical specialties to which it is relevant.
      In order to enable the sorting out of all rare diseases by medical specialty
      and avoid multiple counting of multiclassified entities in statistical analysis, 
      a linearisation process is applied in the Orphanet database to attribute 
      one medical specialty to each clinical entity. 
      The medical speciality is displayed as «Preferential parent».
