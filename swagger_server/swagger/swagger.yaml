      specialties and based on clinical criteria according to diagnostic and therapeutic
      relevance. The result is a collection of data including the ORPHAcode and the

      where the clinical entity is present (Hchid, the unique identifier of the classification,
      name of the classification, ORPHAcode and preferred term of the n+1 and the

  externalDocs:
    description: The Orphanet classification of rare diseases has a polyparental structure.
      It implies that a clinical entity is included in as many classification hierarchies as 
      necessary depending on its clinical presentation and the medical specialties to which 
      it is relevant. In order to enable the sorting out of all rare diseases by medical 
      specialty and avoid multiple counting of multiclassified entities in statistical analysis,
      a linearisation process is applied in the Orphanet database to attribute one medical
      specialty to each clinical entity. 
      The dataset provided in this section includes all rare diseases present in the Orphanet
      nomenclature each with the medical specialty attributed as the preferential parent by Orphanet.
      It is updated once a month.
